## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of React Dashboard on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o react-dashboard -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `yarn dev`

This command will start the app with simultaneously with express server,
set up your database, start local server XAMPP, opensever, or other tool
to start database, connect to it in file 
```shell
src > data > sequelize.js.
```
Also go to  
```shell
src > data > schema.js 
```
and enable mutation. This preparation
will enable to realize CRUD operations locally

### 4. How to create db

Create db. For instance name it "sequelize" and add posts table to it,
your table should have same structure as you can see on the screenshot

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — Node.js server<br>
> [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) — GraphQL server and IDE<br>

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.
